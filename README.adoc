= Bookbag Template

This repository should be used as a template for creating (converting) lab content to
be used in Bookbag environments. 

== Creating (converting) Lab Content

. Create a new repository using this one as a template (use the green button *Use this template*).

. Define which modules you want to include in your lab.

. List the modules in the `workshop.yaml` file.

. Edit the `modules.yaml` file to specify modules names and transitions.

. Edit the modules Asciidoc files (`workshop/content/*.adoc`).

. Define which variables you are going to use in your lab instructions (e.g. `GUID`, `user`, `messages`, and custom variables set by `agnosticd_user_info`).
(This is explained in more detail below.)



== Building the Bookbag Image

There are two ways of building the Bookbag image.

=== Docker build

Just run the `docker build .` command from the project root directory.

NOTE: Podman doesn't work properly on this build yet.

=== Source-2-image build

You'll need to be logged in an OpenShift cluster to use S2I build.

. Create a new OpenShift project.
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc new-project mylab-bookbag*
----

. From the lab project's root directory run the following script: 
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *.workshop/scripts/build-workshop.sh*
----
+
The above command will create a Bookbag image in the cluster's internal image registry 
(usually located at `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/${PROJECT_NAME}`)

== Deploying the Bookbag image

To deploy a Bookbag with lab instructions on an OpenShift cluster:

. Create a new OpenShift project or use an existing one:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc new-project bookbag-test*
or
$ *oc project bookbag-test*
----

. Enter the `deploy` directory and use the template like this:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc process -f bookbag-template.yaml -p IMAGE=quay.io/panni/bookbag-test:0.0.1 -p NAME="bookbag-004" | oc apply -f -*
----
+
* Use the parameter `IMAGE` to specify your Bookbag image. 
It can be located either in your internal OpenShift registry or externally on *quay.io*, for example.
+
* Use the parameter `NAME` to create several separate Bookbags for different users, for example.

. Check if everything was created properly and the Bookbag Pod is running:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc get pods*
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bookbag-004-8785fd986-jdj42    2/2     Running   0           2m
----

. Get the Bookbag's Route:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc get route -lapp=bookbag-004*
NAME          HOST/PORT                                                                   PATH   SERVICES      PORT        TERMINATION     WILDCARD
bookbag-004   bookbag-004-bookbag-test.apps.cluster-xxxx.xxxx.dev.open.redhat.com                bookbag-004   10080-tcp   edge/Redirect   None
----

. Use this Route to open the Bookbag page in your browser.


== Customizing Lab Instructions for Bookbag

Bookbag accepts lab instructions written in Asciidoc or Markdown although in Red Hat Asciidoc is considered the standard.
When editing your instructions for Bookbag some Asciidoc elements might be helpful:

* You can use environment variables throughout the text to provide users with lab-specific information such as
GUID, user credentials, URLs, etc.
* You can use font formatting such as *bold*, _italic_, etc. in command line and code examples.
For example you can use bold font for commands that the user should input on the keyboard, 
italic for parameters that should be replaced, etc.
You can make certain parts of the output bold to attract attention to the changes.

=== AgnosticD User Info in Acsiidoc

Bookbag pods will be deployed and configured so that information set by `agnosticd_user_info` when provisioning the lab is accessible within the content as macros.
In production your bookbag pods will be deployed for you with these settings.
During content development you will likely want to pass thes yourself.

All lab environments have a variable, `GUID` set.
Single-user lab environments also have `user_info_messages` set, containing any messages passed with `agnosticd_user_info`, concatenated into a string with line breaks.
For multi-user lab environments, the variable `user` may be used to get the user name and `user_info_messages` is not available.

You can pass environment variable to the Bookbag container and then use them in lab instructions.
For example, instead of telling the user: "Use this URL and don't forget to replace 'GUID' with your actual GUID"
you can pass the actual GUID to the Bookbag container and create a URL that can be copied and pasted without any changes.

. Create a file called `workshop-vars.js` and define your variables like this for a single-user lab environment:
+
----
{
    "GUID": "acdc",
    "messages": "hello\nworld\n",
    "some_custom_var": "example"
}
----
+
Or if developing for a multi-user lab environment:
+
----
{
    "GUID": "acdc",
    "user": "student1",
    "some_custom_var": "example"
}
----

. In the beginning of each of your Asciidoc files include these variables and define Asciidoc's attributes 
("attributes" is the Asciidoc's word for variables). Here is the example:
----
:USER_GUID: %GUID%
:USERNAME: %user%
:CUSTOM_VAR: %some_custom_var%
----

. Use those variables in Asciidoc files like this: `You username for this lab is {USERNAME}`. 
Avoid mixing environment variables you use in shell commands and variables you use in Asciidoc text.
For example, you might use `${GUID}` in your shell commands--in this case use `{USER_GUID}` in
the text.

. You may want to use a multi-line variable such as output of the deployment command with 
user information. The variable `user_info_messages` in the example above havs multi-line content.
In this case use the `[%hardbreaks]` directive to preserve formatting, like this:
+
----
Here are your informational messages:

[%hardbreaks]
%user_info_messages%

----

. Use the following command to deploy the image and pass the variables:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc process -f ./deploy/bookbag-template.yaml -p IMAGE=<image_location> -p NAME=<bookbag_name> -p WORKSHOP_VARS="$(cat workshop-vars.json)" | oc apply -f -*
----

=== Text formatting in preformatted parts

If you want to use text formatting in command line or source code examples, use the following:

. Add this line at the top of your Asciidoc file:
+
----
:markup-in-source: verbatim,attributes,quotes
----

. Format your command line or source code blocks the following way:
+
------
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc get pods*
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bookbag-005-5ffcccf9cf-584rt   2/2     Running   0          21h
----
------
+
It will look like this:
+
[source,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
$ *oc get pods*
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
bookbag-005-5ffcccf9cf-584rt   2/2     Running   0          21h
----


It is recommended to use a bold font to distinguish the command user is expected to type on the keyboard
from its output.
Also, place a dollar sign prompt `$` in the beginning of the line. 
If the command should be run as root, place a hash `#`.
